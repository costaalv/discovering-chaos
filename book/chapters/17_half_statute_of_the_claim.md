## Three distinct levels

Throughout this work, results of different natures have been obtained. To avoid confusion, and to preserve the integrity of what has been done, it is essential to separate explicitly **three conceptual levels**, which do not collapse into one another, but are logically chained.

This separation is not defensive. It is an act of rigour.

### Level I — What has been strictly demonstrated

At the most fundamental level, this work has established **experimental and computational** results, reproducible and controlled:

- a deterministic operator $M$, constructed from $\Delta_\pi(x)$;
- the systematic emergence of statistics compatible with the GOE class when the operator is observed on a logarithmic scale;
- the persistence of these statistics under:
  - scale sweeps ($X_0$);
  - kernel substitutions;
  - analysis of eigenvalues \textit{and} eigenvectors;
- the explicit destruction of the GOE regime under:
  - linear observation;
  - replacement of the arithmetic signal by white noise.

These facts do not depend on philosophical interpretation, nor on physical analogies. They are **data**.

Nothing beyond this is required in order to accept them.

### Level II — The recognition of universality

A second step consists in recognising that the obtained data are not accidental.

The observed statistical stability, verified independently of microscopic details, alternative operators and position along the real line, corresponds exactly to the operational criterion of universality in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and in the BGS conjecture.

At this level, no claim is made as to *why* universality emerges. It is merely recognised that:

- it emerges;
- it is robust;
- it coincides with the known spectral signature of quantum chaos (GOE).

This recognition is not metaphysical. It is classificatory. It concerns universality in the operational sense of RMT, not global validity over arbitrarily extended spectral windows.

To deny it would require denying the very criterion by which universality is recognised in contemporary mathematical physics.

### Level III — The structural reading

The third level is qualitatively different.

Here the task is no longer to measure or to classify, but to **interpret structurally** what has been observed.

The reading proposed in this work — the centrality of the folding at $1/2$, the functional role of the Unit, the structural equivalence between the real line and the critical line — **is not imposed by the data**.

It is **compatible** with them.

This point is crucial.

The experiment does not compel this reading. But it also **does not contradict it at any point**.

It is an informed, coherent and structurally economical interpretative choice: it provides a minimal structural unification for phenomena that would otherwise remain disconnected.

This coherence emerges only when the interval is anchored at the Unit ($1$). In contrast to traditional asymptotic analysis, which observes the behaviour of the primes in local neighbourhoods or in abstract infinite limits, anchoring at $1$ defines a closed informational system. Within this system $[1, x]$, $1/2$ ceases to be a variable and becomes a functional watershed: the point at which the capacity to generate structure (multiplicity) yields to pure density (additivity).

## On necessity and inevitability

There is a subtle but decisive distinction between two ideas that are frequently conflated:

- logical necessity;
- structural necessity.

This work does not claim that the final reading is logically inevitable. It claims something more restricted — and stronger:

> **given the observed structure, any alternative reading must introduce more hypotheses, not fewer.**

The fold at $1/2$ is not chosen for elegance, but because it is the only arithmetic threshold that separates, in any interval $[1, x]$, primes that generate multiplicity from those that do not. **The functional distinction between structuring primes and stabilising primes eliminates the structural need, within the closed system $[1, x]$, for additional hypotheses**.

The logarithmic scale is not chosen for convenience, but because it is the only scale that stabilises the geometry of density.

The GOE is not invoked as a physical metaphor, but recognised as an independent statistical diagnostic.

None of this forces an ontology. But all of it **severely delimits** the space of coherent interpretations.

> **Data were not lacking. What was lacking was the question of what the primes do, not merely where they are.**

## On proof, foundation and the space of possibility

One point must be stated carefully, as it frequently generates conceptual confusion.

The structural reading proposed in this work does not claim that the folding at $1/2$ must be “proved” as a result internal to the formalism. That would be a categorical error.

The folding at $1/2$ is not an object within the space of analysis. It is the gesture that **defines the very space in which criteria of stability, universality and proof make sense**.

Every possible proof already inhabits that space. To demand a demonstration of the folding as a prior condition is equivalent to demanding a proof of the coordinate system before allowing any measurement.

The experiment does not impose this reading. But neither does it contradict it at any point: any alternative that dispenses with the folding must introduce additional hypotheses, not fewer.

> If the folding at $1/2$ is the gesture that creates the space of structural possibilities, then every proof necessarily inhabits that space. To demand its demonstration as a prior condition is to confuse foundation with consequence.

The proposed reading — the centrality of the folding at $1/2$ — connects Gaussian statistics to Eulerian completeness. The literal $1/2$ is the necessary threshold: below it lies structuring multiplicity; above it, stabilising additivity. The operator $M$ is the tool that translates this phase transition into the language of the GOE.

## The role of the observer

We thus arrive at the decisive point.

The prime numbers do not change. The operator does not change. The statistics do not change.

What changes is the **bserver’s choice**:

- the scale;
- what is regarded as noise or signal;
- the level at which one accepts to terminate the explanation.

The observed structure is indifferent to this choice. It manifests itself whenever the geometric conditions are satisfied.

But the recognition of its coherence **is not automatic**.

It requires a decision: to accept that the observed order is neither an artefact to be discarded nor a mystery to be perpetuated, but a structure to be recognised: $x \to x/2$.

## Scale, regime and the pyramid of observation

A conceptual distinction must be made explicit in order to avoid a misreading of the results presented thus far.

Much of the literature on quantum chaos — including the foundational works of the 1980s — begins with an already constituted spectrum. The analysis then investigates to what extent RMT-type statistics (GOE, GUE or GSE) remain valid as spectral windows are enlarged. In that context, universality is local, and its breakdown at larger scales is not only expected but well understood.

This work operates in a different domain.

Here, the central object is not a given spectrum, but an arithmetic operator constructed point by point, continuously fed by the tension between two fundamental regimes of arithmetic: additivity and multiplicity. The observed spectral behaviour does not result from an a posteriori inspection, but from the explicit maintenance of the appropriate structural axis throughout the construction.

For this reason, the relevant question is not

> how far does statistical universality persist?

but rather  

> under what conditions does it appear?

When the operator $M$ is observed under incompatible scales, Poisson-type statistics appear consistently. When the observation is aligned with the natural geometric scale of the system, GOE-class statistics emerge and remain stable — not through the absence of structure, but precisely through its internal coherence.

Spectral statistics are not an absolute property of the object, but a **relational property between structure and measuring rule**. Off-axis, the system fragments into noise. Aligned with the axis, it manifests coherence.

Unlike the “symphony” of complex zeros, in which symmetry breaking is associated with the emergence of GUE statistics, the arithmetic observed under the operator $M$ preserves an orthogonal structure. The GOE detected here does not arise as a local approximation to a more complex system, but as the signature of a regime in which the fundamental symmetry remains intact.

The distinction between GOE and GUE therefore does not lie in the validity of the data, but in the architecture of the observed domain: one associated with flow dynamics and symmetry breaking, the other with the structural coherence of an operator built upon a preserved axis.

In this context, the absence of GUE statistics is not a negative result, but a direct consequence of the preserved symmetry of the operator $M$, which introduces no mechanisms of reversibility breaking.

Symmetry breaking is associated with regimes of motion and phase transition, as occurs in the domain of complex zeros. Symmetry preservation, by contrast, characterises structurally stable regimes, such as that of prime arithmetic when observed under the operator $M$.

The dominant framing led to the assumption that the music of the primes should inherit the symmetry breaking of their complex guardians. What the operator $M$ reveals is that, at the base of the pyramid, arithmetic remains orthogonal, protected by its own reversibility.

No claim is made here for global RMT validity over arbitrarily extended spectral windows, but for the statistical stability of a regime constructed under continuous structural alignment.

It is in this sense, and in this sense alone, that the statistical universality observed here should be interpreted and compared with the existing literature.

> The statistical universality discussed here is not global, but **conditional**: it emerges only in the regime in which the structural symmetry of the operator $M$ is preserved.

## Point of Transition

With this distinction made explicit, the journey reaches its natural limit.

Nothing has been inflated.  
Nothing has been concealed.  
Nothing has been removed.

What remains is not an additional proof, but an **interpretative responsibility**: to recognise the scope of what has been observed without extrapolating it beyond what the structure itself allows.

The final chapter introduces no new results. It returns to the starting point — the Unit — no longer as an axiom or hypothesis, but as **observable resonance**.
