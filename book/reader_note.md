# Note to the Reader

This text is neither a scientific article nor a formal treatise in the classical sense.

**It is the record of a structural discovery**: the observation that the arithmetic of prime numbers, when examined under a geometrically appropriate scale, **exhibits, under explicitly controlled conditions, stable spectral regimes compatible with Random Matrix Theory (RMT) statistics**, without implying global universality beyond those regimes.

The focus of this work is not the global validity of RMT statistics across arbitrary spectra, but the emergence of statistical regimes under controlled structural alignment.

The reader is not invited to accept conclusions by authority, but to reproduce, observe, and decide.

The path is experimental, not rhetorical.

Nothing here requires belief. Everything requires attention.
