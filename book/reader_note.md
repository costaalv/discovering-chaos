# Note to the Reader

This text is neither a scientific article nor a formal treatise in the classical sense.

It is the record of a structural discovery: the observation that the arithmetic of prime numbers, when viewed at the appropriate scale, **exhibits** universal signatures associated with quantum chaos.

The reader is not invited to accept conclusions by authority, but to reproduce, observe, and decide.

The path is experimental, not rhetorical.

Nothing here requires belief. Everything requires attention.
