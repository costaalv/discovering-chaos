## Editorial Note on the Computational Records

The computational records presented throughout this book — in particular the executable notebooks accompanying the Technical Appendix — **should not be interpreted as supplementary material, illustrative examples, or didactic appendices**.

They fulfil a precise editorial and epistemological function.

The body of the book establishes a complete mathematical, conceptual, and operational structure. The notebooks do not extend this structure, introduce new arguments, or compensate for theoretical gaps. Their function is distinct: **to demonstrate executability**.

In clear terms:

* the argument is developed entirely within the text;
* validity does not rest on the authority of the author;
* verification rests on the possibility of independent execution.

The computational records exist so that the reader may **repeat, alter, perturb, and verify** the procedures described, using neutral and public environments, without reliance on privileged infrastructure, institutional credentials, or prior trust.

They are not “attached data”. They are **operational traces**.

These traces fix an objective criterion:

* if the structure presented is correct, it remains stable under direct execution;
* if it is not, no theoretical formulation can sustain it.

For this reason, the notebooks are not cited as external evidence, nor as subsequent validation. They function as **instruments of audit**, placed at the reader’s disposal only after the conceptual path has been completed.

The book ends when the measuring rod has been set.
The computational records exist solely so that any reader may verify, for themselves, that it does not move.
