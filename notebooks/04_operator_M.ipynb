    "## 1. From signal to structure: the need for a new dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we analysed the behaviour of the one-dimensional function $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$, which quantifies the imbalance between two subsets of primes defined by partitioning the interval. Although informative, this function remains limited to a scalar description of the phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate internal correlations and possible emergent structures associated with this signal, a more powerful instrument is required. The one-dimensional signal must be projected into a higher dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this chapter is to construct a real and symmetric matrix operator: a matrix $M$ that translates the arithmetic signal $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$ into a geometric structure, whose spectral properties (its eigenvalues and eigenvectors) can then be analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The anatomy of the operator $M$: components\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of the operator may appear unconventional at first sight; however, each component is introduced for well-defined operational reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{i,j} = \\cos(\\Delta_\\pi(x_i) \\cdot \\ln(x_j)) + \\cos(\\Delta_\\pi(x_j) \\cdot \\ln(x_i))\n",

    "### Why the logarithm? · Asymptotic scale adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Prime numbers are, by their nature, **multiplicative** objects. Their density, as indicated by the Prime Number Theorem ($\\pi(x) \\approx x / \\ln x$), decays logarithmically. From the asymptotic perspective associated with the distribution of primes, the **relevant scale is logarithmic**, not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $\\ln(x)$ acts as a scale adjustment. The logarithmic transformation aligns the observation scale with the asymptotic behaviour of the prime counting function $\\pi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the cosine? · Normalisation and parity\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the cosine function fulfils two operational roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bounded normalisation** — the argument $\\Delta_\\pi(x)\\ln(x)$ is mapped to the interval $[-1,1]$, preventing uncontrolled growth of the matrix elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parity** — since $\\cos(\\theta)=\\cos(-\\theta)$, the construction makes the operator insensitive to the sign of $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$, preserving only the relative magnitude of the variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Symmetry · the key requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the terms are combined completes the construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{ij} = C_{ij} + C_{ji}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad C_{ij} = \\cos(\\Delta_\\pi(x_i)\\ln(x_j)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which guarantees, by definition, that it is **symmetric** ($M = M^T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this crucial?\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, operators representing observable quantities are **Hermitian**. For real matrices, this is equivalent to symmetry. A real symmetric matrix has the fundamental property that **all its eigenvalues are real**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By constructing $M$ in this way, we ensure that the spectrum of the operator lies on the real line, a necessary condition for stable spectral analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Laboratory · from disorder to structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below implements the matrix operator $M$ and generates a heatmap of its structure for different scales $X_0$. This allows the observation of an empirical behaviour that motivates the subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to observe:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **low $X_0$**, where the signal $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$ is strong and irregular, the matrix does not exhibit evident geometric structure.\n",
    "* For **high $X_0$**, where the signal becomes attenuated and more subtle, **visually distinguishable geometric patterns emerge**.\n"
