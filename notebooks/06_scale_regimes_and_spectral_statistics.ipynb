    "\n",
    "The aim of this laboratory is to record how the relationships between the eigenvalues of $ M $ behave as the **regime of observation** is modified. We will  \n",
    "show that the observed order does not depend solely on the underlying arithmetic object, but on the way scale enters the construction of the operator.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, unfolding is implemented in two different ways, depending on the observation regime:\n",

    "* **`span`** — the extent of the observation window on the logarithmic scale.\n",

    "corresponding to **two observation metrics** applied to the same region of the number line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear scale**  \n",
    "   The sampling points are distributed uniformly in $ x $, corresponding to direct observation on the additive number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logarithmic scale**  \n",
    "   The points are distributed uniformly in $ \\ln x $, aligning the observation with the multiplicative structure implicit in the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are presented **side by side**, allowing a direct visual comparison between the emerging statistical regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The displayed plots are **observational records**. No theoretical interpretation is imposed at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to allow the reader to **observe directly** how the statistics of spectral spacings respond to a change in the measuring ruler, while keeping  \n",
    "both the operator and the analysed arithmetic region fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although the operator is intrinsically logarithmic, observation on the linear scale is retained as a contrast experiment, allowing one to verify how the loss  \n",

    "## 4. Methodological transparency: the computational mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure full reproducibility of the results, the code operates under a strict protocol, divided into four fundamental stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation and sampling**  \n",
    "   An optimised sieve is used to identify prime numbers and to compute the arithmetic signal $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$. The sampling strategy is determined by the  \n",
    "   scale regime: in **linear** mode, the sampling points are contiguous; in **logarithmic** mode, the points are distributed exponentially so as to align  \n",
    "   with the average density of primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Construction of the operator**\n",
    "   The operator is constructed as a harmonic correlation matrix, in which each entry corresponds to the projection of the arithmetic signal onto a logarithmic  \n",
    "   frequency. The matrix is explicitly symmetrised $(M = M^T)$, guaranteeing a well-defined real spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Spectral filtering (*bulk analysis*)**  \n",
    "   Only the central 90% of the spectrum is retained. Edge regions, which are more susceptible to numerical truncation effects, are discarded in order to avoid  \n",
    "   statistical artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Unfolding (normalisation)**  \n",
    "   The spacings are normalised by the mean spectral density. This procedure does not create correlations nor induce universality; it merely removes scale effects  \n",
    "   that could obscure the statistical regime already encoded in the operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Unfolding does not create GOE behaviour — it merely prevents the mean density from hiding it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Parameters of the observation protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental protocol adopted in this notebook is deliberately simple. The construction of the operator is kept fixed, and only the **observation regime**  \n",
    "is varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "No statistical regularisation parameters are introduced, nor are advanced unfolding techniques or adaptive filtering methods employed. The aim is to render the  \n",
    "phenomenon visible before any refined quantification is attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `span` parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `span` controls the extent of the observation window on the logarithmic scale. It defines the multiplicative ratio between the minimum and maximum  \n",
    "values of $x$ included in the analysis, thereby determining￼ determining the effective width of the arithmetic region under examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code, this choice is translated into a common physical window for both observation modes, ensuring that both analyse **the same region of the number line**,  \n",
    "albeit under different metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of `span` is intentionally chosen to be relatively broad in this notebook, so as to allow any structural correlations, if present, to manifest clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absence of jitter and additional parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "No perturbative (*jitter*) parameters are used, nor are local smoothing techniques or statistical resampling procedures applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling grid is deterministic, and the normalisation applied to the spacings is minimal. This choice avoids the premature introduction of technical hypotheses  \n",
    "and preserves a direct reading of the effect of scale on the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "More refined scalar metrics, such as $\\langle r \\rangle$ or $\\Sigma^2(L)$, are deliberately deferred to later stages of the work.\n",

    "## 6. Methodological observation — dependence on the observation ruler\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an **elementary observational protocol**, in which the only relevant degree of freedom is the scale of observation.\n",

    "* the operator does **not** enforce correlated statistics;\n",
    "* correlated statistics **emerge only** when the observation ruler is compatible with the multiplicative structure implicit in the operator.\n",

    "inadequacy) of the observation ruler to the structure of the operator**.\n",
