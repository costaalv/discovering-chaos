    "## 1. The paradox of the growing imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we examined the behaviour of $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$. We observed that, after a brief initial phase with positive values, the curve begins to assume negative values over an interval that grows as $x$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this appears paradoxical. If the absolute difference between structuring and stabilising primes grows indefinitely, would the system not become increasingly **imbalanced**? Would the absolute imbalance between the two subsets of primes never be compensated?\n",
    "\n",
    "This impression is only partial. The apparent imbalance is an **effect of scale**, not of structural breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The appropriate perspective · relative balance\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand systems that grow without bound, it is not sufficient to observe absolute differences — one must adopt a **relative perspective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the total number of primes is the sum of the two contributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi(x) = \\pi_S(x) + \\pi_N(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing throughout by $\\pi(x)$, we obtain the normalised decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1 = \\frac{\\pi_S(x)}{\\pi(x)} + \\frac{\\pi_N(x)}{\\pi(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that, although the absolute counts vary, the fractions of structuring and stabilising primes **always sum exactly to 1**. They are two aspects of the same dynamic balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the Prime Number Theorem (via $\\pi(x) \\sim x/\\ln x$), one has asymptotically $\\pi(x/2)/\\pi(x) \\to 1/2$, and therefore $\\pi_S(x)/\\pi(x) \\to 1/2$ and $\\pi_N(x)/\\pi(x) \\to 1/2$. The contributions associated with the generation of multiples and with the additive occupation of positions become, on average, indistinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting our measure of tension, $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$, we may rewrite it in **normalised** form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta_\\pi(x)}{\\pi(x)} =\n",
    "\\frac{\\pi_N(x)}{\\pi(x)} - \\frac{\\pi_S(x)}{\\pi(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If each term tends to $1/2$, the difference tends to **zero**. The “imbalance” between the two contributions may grow in absolute terms, but *relative to the whole* it disappears. Viewed at large scale, the system tends towards relative equilibrium under normalisation by $\\pi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Interactive environment · convergence towards equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below creates a small experiment to visualise this convergence towards balance. Increase the upper limit $N$ using the *slider* and observe the two graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to observe:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph 1:** The blue and orange curves — structuring and stabilising primes — approach the dashed line at $1/2$ as $x$ increases.\n",
    "2. **Graph 2:** The relative difference between the two contributions oscillates strongly for small values of $x$, but these fluctuations become damped, and the curve converges smoothly towards equilibrium at $0$.\n"
