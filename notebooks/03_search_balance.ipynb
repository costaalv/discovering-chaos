    "to deepen as $x$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this seems paradoxical.  \n",
    "If the absolute difference between **Structuring** and **Stabilising** primes grows indefinitely, does the system not become increasingly **imbalanced**?  \n",
    "Is the “debt” of the stabilising primes never repaid?\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. The Correct Perspective · Relative Harmony\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand systems that grow without bound, it is not sufficient to observe absolute differences — one must adopt a **relative perspective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the total number of primes is the sum of the two forces:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\pi(x) = \\pi_S(x) + \\pi_N(x)\n",

    "This identity tells us that, although absolute counts may vary, the fractions of Structuring and Stabilising primes **always sum exactly to 1**.  \n",
    "They are two aspects of a single dynamic equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prime Number Theorem** guarantees that, as (x \\to \\infty), both fractions converge to the same value: $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.  \n",
    "Structure and stability become, on average, indistinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting our measure of tension, $\\Delta_\\pi(x)$, we may therefore rewrite it in **normalised form**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta_\\pi(x)}{\\pi(x)} =\n",
    "\\frac{\\pi_N(x)}{\\pi(x)} - \\frac{\\pi_S(x)}{\\pi(x)}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "If each term tends to $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, their difference tends to **zero**.  \n",
    "The “debt” between the two forces may grow in absolute terms, but *relative to the whole*, it vanishes.  \n",

    "1. **Plot 1:** The blue and orange curves — Structuring and Stabilising — approach the dashed line at $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, as if attracted by a  \n",
    "   field of symmetry.\n",
    "3. **Plot 2:** The relative difference between the two forces oscillates strongly for small $x$, but these fluctuations are progressively  \n",
